## About Me

Hello! My name is **Mirko Terzic**. I was born in **Toronto, Canada**, but currently, I live in **Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina**. I am a frontend developer with a strong skill set in **HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React,** and **Webpack**. My passion for building intuitive and dynamic user interfaces drives my work, and I strive to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the industry.

In addition to my frontend development expertise, I enjoy creating Android applications using **Java**. This allows me to explore mobile app development and expand my skill set beyond web technologies. My passion for problem-solving extends to algorithmic challenges, and I often spend my free time tackling problems on **LeetCode**, particularly using the **Java** programming language.

I gained my knowledge and skills in frontend development through various resources, including **The Odin Project** and **Frontend Mentor**, which provided me with hands-on experience and a solid foundation in web development. My academic journey also plays a significant role in my development as a software engineer. I am currently in my **fourth and final year** at **Banja Luka College**, where I am pursuing a degree in **Information Technology**.

Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I am a fitness enthusiast who enjoys maintaining an active lifestyle. I work out regularly to stay fit and energized. Running is one of my biggest passions; in **2023**, I completed my first half marathon with a time of **2:15**. In **2024**, I managed to surpass that achievement with a personal best of **1:48**. Currently, I am dedicated to an intensive training regimen as I prepare for my first full marathon.

Whether it‚Äôs coding, solving complex problems, or pushing my physical limits, I thrive on challenges and constantly seek opportunities to grow and improve.
