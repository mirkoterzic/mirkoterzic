## About Me

My name is **Mirko Terzic**. I was born in **Toronto, Canada**, and now live in **Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina**. I specialize in **HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript,** and **React**. My passion lies in creating intuitive and dynamic user interfaces.

I also enjoy developing Android applications using **Java** and tackling algorithmic challenges on **LeetCode** in my spare time.

I am in my **final year** at **Banja Luka College**, pursuing a degree in **Information Technology**.

Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a **fitness enthusiast** who loves running. I recently set a **personal best of 1:48** in a half marathon and am training for my **first full marathon**.

Whether it‚Äôs coding, solving complex problems, or pushing my physical limits, I thrive on challenges and constantly seek opportunities to grow and improve.
